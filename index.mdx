## Why Discord-First Matters

Crypto communities already strategize, educate, and trade inside Discord. SUI Flow keeps wallet actions in the same flow of conversation, enabling:

- Faster response to alpha shared in real time
- Safer interactions (no risky links or browser extensions)
- Higher engagement via native tipping and rewards
- Easier onboarding for non-crypto natives
