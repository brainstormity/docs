## Technology & Security

### Architecture Principles

SUI Flow is built with security and reliability at its core, prioritizing safe key handling, isolated server data, and predictable user experiences.

### Security Measures

1. **Encrypted Private Keys**
   - All private keys are encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption
   - Keys are never transmitted or displayed in plaintext
   - Encryption keys are stored separately from encrypted data
2. **Deterministic Wallet Derivation**
   - Wallets derived from secure seed phrases using ED25519
   - User-specific derivation paths ensure unique addresses
   - BIP-44 compatible derivation standards
3. **Ephemeral Signing**
   - Private keys loaded only at transaction time
   - Immediate disposal after signing
   - No persistent memory of sensitive data
4. **Server Isolation**
   - Each Discord server maintains separate user records
   - Cross-server wallet data is fully isolated
   - Server registration required for bot activation
5. **Gas Reserve Protection**
   - Automatic reserve of 0.01 SUI prevents wallet lockout
   - Users cannot accidentally drain gas funds
   - Ensures future transaction capability

### Smart Contract Integration

SUI Flow leverages proven smart contracts:

- **Dipcoin Protocol**: For swap routing and liquidity operations
- **Native SUI Transfers**: Direct interaction with Sui's built-in transfer functions
- **Move-based Security**: Benefiting from Sui's type-safe smart contract language
