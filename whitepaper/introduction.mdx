## The Problem

### Current Challenges in Crypto Communities

1. **Friction in User Experience**
   - Users constantly switch between Discord and external wallet applications
   - Multiple browser tabs, extensions, and apps create confusion
   - New users face intimidating onboarding processes
2. **Community Engagement Barriers**
   - Tipping community contributors requires complex off-platform transactions
   - Real-time trading discussions can't translate to instant actions
   - Project teams struggle to onboard non-crypto-native members
3. **Security Concerns**
   - External links to wallet sites pose phishing risks
   - Users exposed to malicious dApps and scam sites
   - Confusion about legitimate vs. fraudulent wallet interfaces
4. **Missed Opportunities**
   - Trading alpha shared in Discord can't be acted upon instantly
   - Community rewards require manual, off-platform distribution
   - Seamless project integration remains elusive

SUI Flow exists to eliminate this friction with a native experience that matches how communities already communicate.
