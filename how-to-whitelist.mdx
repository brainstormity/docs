Collect :coin: to claim your whitelist spot. Here are every-day actions that earn coins:

## Invite & Verify

- Track and claim rewards anytime with `/invites-check`.

## Engage in Chat & Updates

- **1 coin per message** in `💬・public-chat` (cooldowns + character minimums keep it fair).
- **1 coin per reaction** in `🗣️・announcements` and `🗣️・quick-updates` when you react within 48 hours.

## Boost the Community

- **X Engagement** – Participate in campaigns inside `🐓・x-raids` to amplify project tweets.
- **Quests** – Complete tasks in `🧩・quests` for rotating coin bounties.
- **Games** – Join events in `🎁・games` for surprise rewards and leaderboard bonuses.

Stay active, stack coins, and redeem your whitelist slot as soon as you hit the required total.
