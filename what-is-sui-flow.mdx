## What is SUI Flow?

SUI Flow is a Discord-native wallet on the Sui Network, letting users manage tokens entirely within Discord—no browser extensions or external apps required. Commands, buttons, and modals run right inside the server, so the community never has to context-switch to stay on-chain.
